# Image Captioning Using Deep Learning

## Overview
This repository provides a Python-based implementation for image captioning using deep learning. The code leverages pre-trained models and neural networks to generate descriptive captions for input images.

## Features
- **Image preprocessing**: Converts images to a format suitable for the model.
- **Feature extraction**: Uses a pre-trained deep learning model (like InceptionV3) for extracting image features.
- **Text generation**: Implements an encoder-decoder model with LSTM to generate captions.
- **Beam search**: Includes support for advanced caption generation techniques to improve output quality.

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Pillow)
- tqdm

Install the required dependencies using:

```sh
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib pillow tqdm

How to Use

    Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-captioning.git
cd image-captioning

Prepare Data:

    Download the COCO dataset (or another dataset of your choice).
    Preprocess the images and captions using the provided preprocessing functions.

Feature Extraction:

    Run the feature extraction code to generate image features using a pre-trained CNN model.

Train the Model:

    Train the encoder-decoder model using the preprocessed data.
    Customize hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and epochs.

Generate Captions:

    Use the trained model to generate captions for test images.
    Apply beam search to improve the quality of generated captions.

Visualize Results:

    Display input images alongside their generated captions using Matplotlib.
